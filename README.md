### Don't just apply. Get hired. Your personal AI career coach for crafting the perfect, job-winning resume.

**ResumeRev.ai** is a production-grade web application that provides a deep, AI-driven analysis of your resume against a specific job description. It moves beyond simple keyword matching to offer a comprehensive, multi-faceted evaluation, helping you understand precisely how a recruiter and an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) will perceive your application.

## ‚ú® Key Features

  * üß† **Multi-Factor ATS Scoring:** Get a detailed score (0-100) based on a weighted analysis of semantic match, skill gaps, experience relevance, quantifiable achievements, and content quality.

  * üéØ **Role-Specific Evaluation:** The AI engine intelligently detects the target role (e.g., Backend, Frontend, Data) and dynamically adjusts its scoring rubric to prioritize what matters most for that position.

  * ü§ñ **Recruiter Simulation:** A "30-second scan" feature powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) that gives you a first-impression summary, identifying immediate strengths and areas that lack clarity, just like a busy recruiter would.

  * üìä **Advanced Project & Experience Analysis:** Each project and past job on your resume is individually scored for its relevance to the job description, using semantic embeddings to understand the context of your work.

  * üìÑ **Professional PDF Reporting:** Download a clean, minimalist, and professional PDF summary of your full analysis, perfect for sharing or personal review.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The application follows a modern, modular, and scalable design pattern:

1.  **Frontend (Client):** A user submits their resume and a job description via the Tailwind CSS interface.
2.  **API (FastAPI):** The request hits a specific endpoint (e.g., `/analyze/`).
3.  **Core Parser:** The system first extracts and structures all text, skills, projects, and experiences from the resume file.
4.  **Analysis Engine:** The structured data is passed to a suite of specialized modules:
      * `ats_scorer.py`: Calculates the multi-factor scores.
      * `role_detector.py`: Determines the job profile.
      * `project_scorer.py`: Scores individual projects.
5.  **Database (SQLAlchemy):** The final analysis result is stored in the database.
6.  **Response:** The complete analysis object is sent back to the frontend as a JSON response to be dynamically rendered.
